<h1>LEARN HTML :)</h1>
<pre> [1] The web has been around for more than 25 years now, experiencing euphoric
    early expansion, an economic-driven bust, an innovation-driven rebirth, and
    constant evolution along the way. One thing is certain: the web as a communication
    and commercial medium is here to stay. Not only that, it has found
    its way onto devices such as smartphones, tablets, TVs, and more. There have
    never been more opportunities to put web design know-how to use.
    Through my experience teaching web design courses and workshops, I’ve
    had the opportunity to meet people of all backgrounds who are interested
    in learning how to build web pages. Allow me to introduce you to just a few:
    “I’ve been a print designer for 17 years, and now I am feeling pressure to provide
    web design services.”
    “I’ve been a programmer for years, but I want shift my skills to web development
    because there are good job opportunities in my area.”
    “I tinkered with web pages in high school and I think it might be something
    I’d like to do for a living.”
    “I’ve made a few sites using themes in WordPress, but I’d like to expand my
    skills and create custom sites for small businesses.”
    Whatever the motivation, the first question is always the same: “Where do I
    start?” It may seem like there is a mountain of stuff to learn, and it’s not easy
    to know where to jump in. But you have to start somewhere.
    This chapter provides an overview of the profession before we leap into
    building sites. It begins with an introduction to the roles and responsibilities
    associated with creating websites, so you can consider which role is right for
    you. I will also give you a heads-up on the equipment and software you will
    be likely to use—in other words, the tools of the trade.

    WHERE DO I START?
    Maybe you are reading this book as part of a full course on web design and
    development. Maybe you bought it to expand your current skill set on your
    own. Maybe you just picked it up out of curiosity. Whatever the case, this
    book is a good place to start learning what makes the web tick.
    There are many levels of involvement in web design, from building a small
    site for yourself to making it a full-blown career. You may enjoy being a “fullstack”
    web developer or just specializing in one skill. There are a lot of ways
    you can go.
    If you are interested in pursuing web design or production as a career, you’ll
    need to bring your skills up to a professional level. Employers may not
    require a web design degree, but they will expect to see working sample sites
    that demonstrate your skills and experience. These sites can be the result of
    class assignments, personal projects, or a site for a small business or organization.
    What’s important is that they look professional and have well-written,
    clean HTML; style sheets; and scripts behind the scenes.
    If your involvement is at a smaller scale—say you just have a site or two
    you’d like to publish—you may find using a template on an online website
    service is a great head start (see the sidebar “I Just Want My Own Site”). Most
    allow you to tweak the underlying code, so what you learn in this book will
    help you customize the template to your liking.



    <b>Authoring/markup (HTML)
    Authoring is the process of preparing content for delivery on the web, or more
    specifically, marking up the content with HTML tags that describe its content
    and function.</b>
    <i>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the authoring language used to create
    web page documents. The current version (and the version documentedin this book) is HTML 5.2. Appendix D, From HTML+ to HTML5, tells the history
    of HTML and lists what makes HTML5 unique.
    HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language, which means
    it is a system for identifying and describing the various components of a
    document such as headings, paragraphs, and lists. The markup indicates the
    document’s underlying structure (you can think of it as a detailed, machinereadable
    outline). You don’t need programming skills—only patience and
    common sense—to write HTML.
    The best way to learn HTML is to write out some pages by hand, as we will
    be doing in the exercises in Part II of this book.</i>
